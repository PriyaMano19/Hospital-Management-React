##  Project Description 
The hospital management system contains computerized patient registration, sorting of their information into the system, and patient registration. The software can automatically provide a search facility for each patient and the employees. It has a search feature that lets you see each availability's status. The availability of a doctor and patient information can be searched for by the user. With the use of a username and password, one can access the hospital management system. A receptionist or an administrator can access it. They alone can add data to the database. The information is simple to retrieve. The user interface is quite simple[05,06]. 
Data processing is quick and very well for personal usage. For multispecialty hospitals, the Health Board System is created to cover a variety of hospital administrative procedures. The management of hospital analysis and activity-based pricing can be increased using hospital management systems. The hospital management system enables you to grow your business and enhance productivity and work quality[02]. The goal of the hospital management system project is to simplify all management processes, including patient registration, doctor appointments, and prescription writing. 
The user must go through a few registers. Time is lost because of this. Therefore, using this system will make it simple to manage everything process. Therefore, the development team are designing this system that can help both patients and hospital workers using the motivation of this scenario, which was frequently performed in hospitals. So, the stakeholders would like to have this system that makes hospitals work quickly and efficiently.
